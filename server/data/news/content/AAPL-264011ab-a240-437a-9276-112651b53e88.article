It has built a huge <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/fintech-stocks/\">fintech</a> business, which it started by figuring out a way for underbanked customers to be able to shop on its digital platform. That resulted in a digital payment platform that has now expanded into a full financial services app and credit business.</p>\n<p>The company has been around since 1999, almost as long as Amazon. MercadoLibre went public in 2007, and it's still reporting incredibly high growth. During the peak of the pandemic, it reported triple-digit sales growth for five consecutive quarters. While that's decelerated, it's still high double digits. Total sales increased 69% year over year in the third quarter, while Amazon's increased 9%.</p>\n<div data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"><div data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"> <p><img data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/MELI.png\"></p> </div> <div data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"><div data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"><p>Today's Change</p> <p>(-0.58%) -$9.28</p> <p>Current Price</p> <p>$1,581.60</p></div> <p data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"><svg data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\" id=\"arrow-thin-down\" viewBox=\"0 0 19 19\"><title data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\" id=\"arrow-thin-down-title\">Arrow-Thin-Down</title> <path data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\" d=\"M18.3047 9.22656L18.0312 8.95312C17.8359 8.75781 17.5625 8.75781 17.3672 8.95312L10.4141 15.9062V1.21875C10.4141 0.984375 10.1797 0.75 9.94531 0.75H9.55469C9.28125 0.75 9.08594 0.984375 9.08594 1.21875V15.9062L2.09375 8.95312C1.89844 8.75781 1.625 8.75781 1.42969 8.95312L1.15625 9.22656C0.960938 9.42188 0.960938 9.69531 1.15625 9.89062L9.39844 18.1328C9.59375 18.3281 9.86719 18.3281 10.0625 18.1328L18.3047 9.89062C18.5 9.69531 18.5 9.42188 18.3047 9.22656Z\"></path></svg></p></div></div>\n<p>The core e-commerce business is still robust.
