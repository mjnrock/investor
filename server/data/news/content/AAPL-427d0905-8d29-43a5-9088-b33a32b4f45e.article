If RSI moves above 70, that is a warning sign. </p> <p>On occasion RSI has reached levels of 90 or above with certain individual stocks. If RSI hits these levels and stays there, it’s called “burying the needle.” It means that RSI is stuck at such a high level that the oscillator either flatlined or “hit a wall.” In this example, look at other overbought/oversold indicators for clues.&nbsp;</p> <p>Extreme overbought readings combined with spiking charts reflect serious investor overconfidence. History has proven that this type of market tends to occur before market corrections and crashes, like in 2000 and 2008. This is not to say the market will crash or correct; it is to say that these overbought levels cannot be sustained.&nbsp;</p> <p>If RSI rises too far and too fast, taking money off the table is a wise decision (but this doesn’t mean to sell everything).
