You’ll save on interest if you pay upfront for your vehicle. For example, you could save as much as $3,100 on interest if you finance a 2024&nbsp;Honda \n        <a data-track-hover=\"QuotePeek\" data-charting-symbol=\"STOCK/US/XNYS/HMC\" href=\"/investing/stock/HMC?mod=MW_story_quote\" target=\"_blank\">HMC,\n        <bg-quote field=\"percentchange\" format=\"0,000.00%\" channel=\"/zigman2/quotes/207173990/composite\">+0.46%</bg-quote></a>\n       Accord&nbsp;Hybrid Touring (starts at $38,540) after making a down payment of 20% at 3.9% interest for 60 months.</p> <p><strong>2.&nbsp;Research</strong></p> <p>Do a deep dive into car research. Check Kelley Blue Book values to get the fair market range for the vehicle you want to purchase.&nbsp;Compare models&nbsp;and determine what features you can do without to help lower the price point. If buying new, check&nbsp;expert car <a href=\"https://www.kbb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviews</a>. You can search for reviews on cars you like dating back a decade or more and learn from our experts.</p> <p><strong>Read:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-most-and-least-reliable-car-brands-for-2024-according-to-consumer-reports-386681ac?mod=article_inline\">The most and least reliable car brands for 2024, according to Consumer Reports</a></p> <p><strong>3.&nbsp;Look for manufacturer or dealership financing deals</strong></p> <p>Monitor the manufacturer and dealership financing deals and jump when you see an attractive low or&nbsp;0%&nbsp;interest rate offer if your credit is spotless. If it’s not, read on for other ways to save money during car buying.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>4.&nbsp;Check your credit score before you shop</strong></p> <p>If you know your credit isn’t the best, find out your score. If you can wait to buy a car and work on lifting your credit score, it could help you qualify for a better, lower interest rate if financing a car. It also helps to inform your budget.</p> <p><strong>5.&nbsp;Prequalify for a loan</strong></p> <p>If you need car loan financing, check with different lenders for interest-rate offers on new and used cars before shopping. It helps you keep your budget in check and prevents you from overspending.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>6.&nbsp;Stick to a budget</strong></p> <p>Use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autotrader.com/car-affordability-calculator?mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">car affordability calculator</a>&nbsp;to know what you can afford and use that as a guideline when shopping for a car. It might save you thousands because you will not spend outside your budget.</p> <p><strong>7.&nbsp;Estimate your payment before you buy</strong></p> <p>In addition to using the car affordability calculator, you can also estimate your vehicle payment before you buy using an&nbsp;auto loan calculator, plugging in the value of the vehicle, tax and interest rate, preferred loan term, down payment, expected trade-in value with the amount if any that you owe. It will estimate what you will pay monthly for the vehicle you want. Then, all you need to obtain is a car insurance estimate. If leasing, use our leasing calculator tool. The calculator also offers a leasing calculator option.</p> <p><strong>8.&nbsp;Calculate car insurance and taxes</strong></p> <p>One way to save yourself money is to make sure you know your bottom line for car insurance and taxes before purchase. Request the VIN on the vehicle from the dealership or look for it online and obtain several car insurance quotes on the type of vehicle you wish to purchase (it doesn’t need to be the exact trim package). Many car insurers will provide quotes without pulling your credit. For taxes, you can find your state’s tax rate online through a quick search.</p> <p><strong>Read: </strong><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-electric-vehicle-tax-credits-will-work-in-2024-and-a-list-of-cars-that-qualify-716d4679?mod=article_inline\">How electric vehicle tax credits will work in 2024, and a list of cars that qualify</a></p> <p><strong>9.&nbsp;Consider a lower trim level</strong></p> <p>By choosing a lower trim level, you could save thousands of dollars. For example, the 2024&nbsp;Ford \n        <a data-track-hover=\"QuotePeek\" data-charting-symbol=\"STOCK/US/XNYS/F\" href=\"/investing/stock/F?mod=MW_story_quote\" target=\"_blank\">F,\n        <bg-quote field=\"percentchange\" format=\"0,000.00%\" channel=\"/zigman2/quotes/208911460/composite\">-0.40%</bg-quote></a>\n       Mustang&nbsp;starts at about $31,000, and each trim level adds new features, with the highest trim package starting at more than $63,000. You might want to go big, but you could save tens of thousands by sticking to a lower trim level.</p> <p><strong>10. Compare new vs. used</strong></p> <p>This one is tricky. These days, some new vehicles cost about the same as used if you finance a car due to higher interest rates on used vs. new. But deals can be had on less popular vehicles or those on car dealership lots they want to get rid of quickly. Just ensure you get it inspected by a certified mechanic. Buying a used car can help save thousands of dollars, especially if you pay in cash.</p> <p><strong>See: </strong><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/odometer-fraud-is-on-the-risehow-to-protect-yourself-f9950266?mod=article_inline\">Odometer fraud is on the rise—how to protect yourself</a></p> <p><strong>11. Get an instant cash offer on your trade-in vehicle</strong></p> <p>Before you head to a dealership with a trade-in, shop your used car around with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autotrader.com/instant-cash-offer/?LNX=TIMATCEDITORIAL/&amp;mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">one-stop-shop tool</a>. Yes, you’ll get texts and emails from dealerships. But you can quickly see the value of your vehicle come to life with offers that potentially can be negotiated, especially if you decide to purchase from the same dealership. Before you trade, find the value of your vehicle.</p> <p><strong>12. Window shop first</strong></p> <p>Before you settle on a vehicle, test drive several makes and models you like. It’s better to test drive and walk away before a salesperson pressures you into deciding on something right then and there.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Check out: </strong><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/some-good-trends-are-happening-in-car-affordability-d77b8a2a?mod=article_inline\">Some good trends are happening in car affordability</a></p> <p><strong>13. Consider an outgoing model</strong></p> <p>If you like a vehicle and there’s a new model year debut coming, use that as a trigger to buy the outgoing model. You might save several thousand dollars if the dealership is willing to bargain.</p> <p><strong>14.&nbsp;Be willing to walk away</strong></p> <p>This is necessary if the pressure seems too great or you’re not ready. It also can be a calculated move.&nbsp;<strong>PRO TIP</strong>: I went to a dealership on a Tuesday evening, about an hour before closing, to test drive a few vehicles. Because the dealership was closing, there was no pressure to buy on the spot. It was easy to walk away. I did the same thing at another dealership the next weeknight evening. I was able to quickly determine the vehicle I preferred with the right features I wanted, including display size, wireless Apple \n        <a data-track-hover=\"QuotePeek\" data-charting-symbol=\"STOCK/US/XNAS/AAPL\" href=\"/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote\" target=\"_blank\">AAPL,\n        <bg-quote field=\"percentchange\" format=\"0,000.00%\" channel=\"/zigman2/quotes/202934861/composite\">+0.22%</bg-quote></a>\n       CarPlay, and strategically placed USB-C outlets. Walking away gave me time to plan my negotiation strategy, texting with one dealership while in person at another in almost real-time. Ultimately, it saved me $8,000, including getting more money for a pickup truck trade-in. I used the&nbsp;Kelley Blue Book Instant Cash Offer&nbsp;tool to see what other dealers would offer and leveraged those prices on the spot.

Shop online and check prices at multiple dealerships</strong></p> <p>With your smartphone, check pricing at numerous dealerships and start communicating with a salesperson. Be ready to respond quickly, and don’t feel shy about using what one dealership offers versus another. You can buy your entire vehicle&nbsp;online, though most still prefer an in-person test drive.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>16. Trade in your older model for credit</strong></p> <p>If you have another car and it’s a highly sought-after model, trade it to the dealership and get the credit toward your new vehicle. In some states, it also&nbsp;reduces the taxes&nbsp;you pay on the car you purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>17. Negotiate</strong></p> <p>If you see an add-on like paint and fabric protection you don’t want or need, negotiate that off your bottom line. If you know a dealer fee that adds hundreds of dollars, ask for a breakdown of what the cost covers. It just might save you up to a few thousand dollars.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>18. Lease a car instead</strong></p> <p>You may save money on a new or used car lease if you can’t afford an outright purchase.
