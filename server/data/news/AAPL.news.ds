			"textContent": "\nMajor stock market indexes clung to modest gains in afternoon trading Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued stretching to new highs.\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nThe Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were all up around 0.2% on the stock market today. As the Dow tapped yet another record high, the S&P 500 continues to flirt with its all-time record. And the Nasdaq keeps setting new 52-week highs in the current rally.\nMeanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 gave back earlier gains and skidded 0.4%. And the 10-year Treasury yield added 7 basis points to 3.86%.\nThe Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, edged up 0.1%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) faded 0.2%.\nVolume fell on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Wednesday.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor reported initial jobless claims for the week ended Dec. 23 at 218,000 compared with 210,000 expected. The figure also was higher than the revised 206,000 for the prior week, according to Econoday.\nStock Market Movers: Chinese Stocks Act Strong\nChina-based electric vehicle maker Li Auto (LI) surged more than 3% and reclaimed its 50-day moving average. The stock is in a consolidation with an official 47.33 buy point, although investors could use an alternate entry at 42.35. LI retook its 50-day line on Thursday.\nAnother China firm, e-commerce platform operator PDD Holdings (PDD) bumped up more than 1% in light volume.\nIBD Leaderboard name Arm Holdings (ARM) spiked nearly 5% and is extended from a cup-with-handle base with a 64.92 buy point. Shares of the semiconductor stock hit an all-time high on Thursday.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped more than 2% and entered the 20% profit zone of a cup-with-handle base with a 122.11 buy point. The chip stock led the S&P 500 on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, IBD 50 chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) added 0.7% and is in a flat base with a 505.48 buy point. The buy point coincides with the stock's 52-week high reached on Nov. 20.\nNvidia's flat base builds upon the double-bottom pattern the chipmaker broke out of last month. Shares are considered to also be in a buy zone with a 476.09 entry out of that double bottom.\nDow Jones Movers On The Stock Market\nAmong Dow Jones components, Amgen (AMGN) rose to touch the 288.46 buy point of a cup base in recent trades. Besides tentative price action, volume is running well below average levels, adding suspicion about the breakout.\nApple (AAPL) gained 0.3% and is in the buy zone of a cup-with-handle base with a 192.93 buy point.\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) gave back earlier gains and dipped 0.3%. Medicare drug price negotiations are set for Feb. 1.\nFurther, Boeing (BA) slid more than 1% and remains extended from the 243.10 buy point of a cup base. Shares have eased from a 52-week high reached on Dec. 21. The aerospace and defense stock was the biggest loser on the Dow today.\nRetail Platform Stock Reverses\nOutside the Dow on the stock market, JD.com (JD) popped 3%. Bloomberg reported that the Chinese e-commerce giant will give significant salary increases in 2024. The company said in a social media statement its retail employees are expected to get an average wage increase of more than 20% next year.\nThe move is part of a plan by JD to keep up with competitors Alibaba (BABA) and ByteDance. Shares of JD are down nearly 50% this year, and sales have dropped for four straight quarters. BABA shares gained 1.5%.\nIBD 50 stock GigaCloud Technologies (GCT) reversed lower and sank nearly 3% after reaching a 52-week high early Thursday. Shares of the Hong-Kong based company jumped 21.4% on Nov. 30 following the company's higher-than-expected earnings and sales for the third quarter. The stock continued to climb until reaching the prior high made in September.\nQuarterly sales growth accelerated to 39% from 23% and 14% the prior two quarters. GCT holds a best-possible score of 99 by IBD for Composite Rating, EPS Rating and Relative Strength Rating. Its global platform connects business-to-business suppliers and resellers.\nTidewater Ebbs; ELF Beauty Primps\nIBD 50 stock Tidewater (TDW) pulled back 4% after hitting a 52-week high on Wednesday and fell back below the 73.55 buy point.\nELF Beauty (ELF) advanced 0.6% on the stock market.

			"textContent": "\n\n\n  \n         \n       Wedbush analyst Dan Ives on Thursday raised Microsoft Corp.’s price target on a bullish view for its Copilot chat bot and other artificial intelligence products. Microsoft’s stock \n        MSFT,\n        +0.32%\n       was up by 0.3% during regular trading on Thursday.  Ives compared Microsoft’s prospects in artificial intelligence (AI) to Apple Inc.’s  \n        AAPL,\n        +0.22%\n       iPhone, a blockbuster product since its 2007 launch. \n      \n       “We view this as Microsoft’s ‘iPhone moment’ with AI set to change the cloud growth trajectory in Redmond over the next few years,” Ives said. The stock has yet to price in the next wave of cloud and AI expansion due to Microsoft’s “strong competitive cloud edge” compared to Amazon.com Inc. \n        AMZN,\n        +0.03%\n       and Alphabet Inc.’s \n        GOOG,\n        -0.11%\n       Google unit, Ives said. Ives lifted Microsoft’s \n        MSFT,\n        +0.32%\n       12-month target price by $25 to $450 a share and reiterated his outperform rating as well as the stock’s status as a “best ideas” pick. He cited incrementally bullish checks with Microsoft’s AI customers and “game-changing” monetization of its Copilot product “now on the doorstep” for 2024. Wedbush estimated Copilot could generate $25 billion in revenue for Microsoft by fiscal year 2025. “In a nutshell based on our recent work in the field we believe over the next three years over 60% of its MSFT installed base will ultimately be on this AI functionality for the enterprise/ commercial which changes the landscape,” Ives said. Along with the iPhone, Ives compared the prospects for AI to the mainstream adoption of the internet starting with the debut of the Netscape browser some 28 years ago. “We continue to believe this is a ‘1995 Moment’ with a transformational tech spending wave not seen since the start of the Internet in the mid 90’s with AI now hitting the shores of the tech sector,” Ives said. Microsoft’s stock, which is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is up by 56.4% in 2023, compared to a 13.8% rise by the DJIA.

It has built a huge <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/fintech-stocks/\">fintech</a> business, which it started by figuring out a way for underbanked customers to be able to shop on its digital platform. That resulted in a digital payment platform that has now expanded into a full financial services app and credit business.</p>\n<p>The company has been around since 1999, almost as long as Amazon. MercadoLibre went public in 2007, and it's still reporting incredibly high growth. During the peak of the pandemic, it reported triple-digit sales growth for five consecutive quarters. While that's decelerated, it's still high double digits. Total sales increased 69% year over year in the third quarter, while Amazon's increased 9%.</p>\n<div data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"><div data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"> <p><img data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/MELI.png\"></p> </div> <div data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"><div data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"><p>Today's Change</p> <p>(-0.58%) -$9.28</p> <p>Current Price</p> <p>$1,581.60</p></div> <p data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\"><svg data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\" id=\"arrow-thin-down\" viewBox=\"0 0 19 19\"><title data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\" id=\"arrow-thin-down-title\">Arrow-Thin-Down</title> <path data-v-5f7cbef2=\"\" d=\"M18.3047 9.22656L18.0312 8.95312C17.8359 8.75781 17.5625 8.75781 17.3672 8.95312L10.4141 15.9062V1.21875C10.4141 0.984375 10.1797 0.75 9.94531 0.75H9.55469C9.28125 0.75 9.08594 0.984375 9.08594 1.21875V15.9062L2.09375 8.95312C1.89844 8.75781 1.625 8.75781 1.42969 8.95312L1.15625 9.22656C0.960938 9.42188 0.960938 9.69531 1.15625 9.89062L9.39844 18.1328C9.59375 18.3281 9.86719 18.3281 10.0625 18.1328L18.3047 9.89062C18.5 9.69531 18.5 9.42188 18.3047 9.22656Z\"></path></svg></p></div></div>\n<p>The core e-commerce business is still robust.

Krinsky adds he doesn’t see another big upside move much beyond that level and if the tide turns he warily eyes initial support at 4,600, and with 4,200-4,300 as major long-term support.</p> <p>Furthermore, he spies some concerning issues, such as an uptick in the CBOE VIX index \n        <a data-track-hover=\"QuotePeek\" href=\"/investing/index/VIX?mod=MW_story_quote\" target=\"_blank\">VIX</a>\n       before the Christmas break, even as the market gained ground. </p> <p>The VIX, an option-based gauge of expected S&amp;P 500 volatility, tends to fall when the market goes up, so its rise may indicate some wariness bubbling below the surface. </p> <p>It’s a scenario similar to the market shakeouts witnessed in January 2018 and September 2020, Krinsky notes, and

			"textContent": "Some technical analysts with a bearish bent also recognize the runes look favorable for the S&P 500 following the latest surge. For example BTIG’s Jonathan Krinsky says the benchmark index may challenge 5,000 early n 2024.\n       But let’s not get carried away. Krinsky adds he doesn’t see another big upside move much beyond that level and if the tide turns he warily eyes initial support at 4,600, and with 4,200-4,300 as major long-term support. Furthermore, he spies some concerning issues, such as an uptick in the CBOE VIX index \n        VIX\n       before the Christmas break, even as the market gained ground.  The VIX, an option-based gauge of expected S&P 500 volatility, tends to fall when the market goes up, so its rise may indicate some wariness bubbling below the surface.  It’s a scenario similar to the market shakeouts witnessed in January 2018 and September 2020, Krinsky notes, and comes as broad market sentiment is chipper with investors’ “positioning back near multi-year highs.”\n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n            \n      \n    \n      \n      \n\n    \n      \n          \n            Source: BTIG\n          \n  \n    \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       With this in mind, Krinsky  appears wary of chasing sectors of the market that have already been big winners and has his sights on a sector he considers “a solid contrarian idea”: healthcare. As the chart below shows, the healthcare sector has meandered within a trading range for about two and a half years.  “An upside resolution from this range in ’24 could be powerful and would suggest relative outperformance after testing 2021 lows,” says Krinsky. “HC has only been the best performing sector in a year once over the last 15 years (2018), and while we can’t say it will be the best in 2024, we do think it is worth a strong look for relative outperformance.”\n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n            \n      \n    \n      \n      \n\n    \n      \n          Source: BTIG\n  \n    \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       Within the sector, Krinksy notes that smaller companies, as represented by the Invesco S&P SmallCap Health Care ETF \n        PSCH,\n       has begun to break a nearly three-year downtrend relative to bigger companies, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF \n        XLV.\n       “Much like the broad market, we expect small-cap [to do better than] large-cap initially in ’24,” he says.

Eli Lilly on the other hand doesn’t look promising from a technical perspective, says Krinsky: “The stock is up seven years in a row and 12 of the last 13. Feels a bit parabolic lately with weekly momentum rolling over as the stock breaks its medium-term uptrend.”Markets\n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n            \n      \n    \n      \n      \n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       U.S. stock-index futures \n        ES00,\n        +0.01%\n       \n        YM00,\n        +0.07%\n       \n        NQ00,\n        -0.11%\n       are mixed as benchmark Treasury yields \n        BX:TMUBMUSD10Y\n       nudge higher.

Other sources reportedly confirmed these images.See Also: Windows 11 Upgrade Will Put 240M Computers On The Brink Of Becoming E-Waste: ReportApple is speculated to be modifying Apple Music and Apple Podcasts to suit the new display, which will exhibit a blurred animation based on the colors of the album art when a song or podcast is playing. There’s also the potential for displaying significant notifications.The first suggestions of Apple working on new HomePods with displays and cameras came from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in 2021. Earlier this year, renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple intends to launch a redesigned HomePod with a 7-inch display in the first half of 2024.Why It Matters: This potential redesign of the HomePod comes amid growing competition in the smart home market. In January 2023, Apple released its second-generation HomePod with advanced computational audio and Siri integration after discontinuing the original in 2021.The addition of a screen could further threaten the dominance of competitors like Amazon AMZN. In March 2023, Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, predicted that Apple was planning to unveil a revamped HomePod in the first half of 2024 featuring a 7-inch panel.

You should consider the Vanguard Large-Cap ETF (<a href=\"/funds/etf/VV?art_rec=blog-style_box_etf-commentary_body-ticker-ticker-VV\" rel=\"VV\" show-add-portfolio=\"true\" id=\"commentary_body-VV-txt\"><span>VV</span></a> <span> - </span> <a href=\"/registration/premium/login/?ALERT=ETF225&amp;mode=etf&amp;t=VV&amp;ADID=ZCOM_ARTICLEBODY_TCK&amp;icid=BLOG-Style_Box_ETF-2202963-free_report-commentary_body-VV\" alt=\"Free Report\" title=\"Free Report\">Free Report</a>)    , a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 01/27/2004.</p><p>The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $30.72 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.</p><p><b>Why Large Cap Blend</b></p><p>Large cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.</p><p>Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.</p><p><b>Costs</b></p><p>Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.<br></p><p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.</p><p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.41%.</p><p><b>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</b></p><p>Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.40% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (<a href=\"/stock/quote/AAPL?art_rec=blog-style_box_etf-commentary_body-ticker-ticker-AAPL\" rel=\"AAPL\" show-add-portfolio=\"true\" id=\"commentary_body-AAPL-txt\"><span>AAPL</span></a> <span> - </span> <a href=\"/registration/premium/login/?ALERT=zrmodule&amp;mode=zramodule&amp;t=AAPL&amp;ADID=ZCOM_ARTICLEBODY_TCK&amp;icid=BLOG-Style_Box_ETF-2202963-free_report-commentary_body-AAPL\" alt=\"Free Report\" title=\"Free Report\">Free Report</a>)     accounts for about 7.45% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp.

The CRSP US Large Cap Index includes U.S. companies that comprise the top 85% of investable market capitalization and are traded on NYSE, NYSE Market, NASDAQ or ARCA.</p><p>The ETF return is roughly 27.50% so far this year and was up about 27.91% in the last one year (as of 12/28/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $172.79 and $219.17.</p><p>The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 17.90% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space.

			"textContent": "\n                        Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market? You should consider the Vanguard Large-Cap ETF (VV  -  Free Report)    , a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 01/27/2004.The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $30.72 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.41%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.40% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)     accounts for about 7.45% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report)     and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report)    .The top 10 holdings account for about 29.62% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskVV seeks to match the performance of the CRSP US Large Cap Index before fees and expenses. The CRSP US Large Cap Index includes U.S. companies that comprise the top 85% of investable market capitalization and are traded on NYSE, NYSE Market, NASDAQ or ARCA.The ETF return is roughly 27.50% so far this year and was up about 27.91% in the last one year (as of 12/28/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $172.79 and $219.17.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 17.90% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 550 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesVanguard Large-Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, VV is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market.

It helps you keep your budget in check and prevents you from overspending.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>6.&nbsp;Stick to a budget</strong></p> <p>Use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autotrader.com/car-affordability-calculator?mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">car affordability calculator</a>&nbsp;to know what you can afford and use that as a guideline when shopping for a car. It might save you thousands because you will not spend outside your budget.</p> <p><strong>7.&nbsp;Estimate your payment before you buy</strong></p> <p>In addition to using the car affordability calculator, you can also estimate your vehicle payment before you buy using an&nbsp;auto loan calculator, plugging in the value of the vehicle, tax and interest rate, preferred loan term, down payment, expected trade-in value with the amount if any that you owe. It will estimate what you will pay monthly for the vehicle you want. Then, all you need to obtain is a car insurance estimate. If leasing, use our leasing calculator tool. The calculator also offers a leasing calculator option.</p> <p><strong>8.&nbsp;Calculate car insurance and taxes</strong></p> <p>One way to save yourself money is to make sure you know your bottom line for car insurance and taxes before purchase. Request the VIN on the vehicle from the dealership or look for it online and obtain several car insurance quotes on the type of vehicle you wish to purchase (it doesn’t need to be the exact trim package). Many car insurers will provide quotes without pulling your credit. For taxes, you can find your state’s tax rate online through a quick search.</p> <p><strong>Read: </strong><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-electric-vehicle-tax-credits-will-work-in-2024-and-a-list-of-cars-that-qualify-716d4679?mod=article_inline\">How electric vehicle tax credits will work in 2024, and a list of cars that qualify</a></p> <p><strong>9.&nbsp;Consider a lower trim level</strong></p> <p>By choosing a lower trim level, you could save thousands of dollars.

			"textContent": "In the current economy of higher interest rates and tighter credit, how can car shoppers save money when purchasing a vehicle? Use our checklist and money-saving tips to keep cash in your pocket and obtain the best car-buying deal.\n      How to save money when buying a car 1. Pay cash One of the best ways to save thousands of dollars is to pay for your car in cash. You’ll save on interest if you pay upfront for your vehicle. For example, you could save as much as $3,100 on interest if you finance a 2024 Honda \n        HMC,\n        +0.46%\n       Accord Hybrid Touring (starts at $38,540) after making a down payment of 20% at 3.9% interest for 60 months. 2. Research Do a deep dive into car research. Check Kelley Blue Book values to get the fair market range for the vehicle you want to purchase. Compare models and determine what features you can do without to help lower the price point. If buying new, check expert car reviews. You can search for reviews on cars you like dating back a decade or more and learn from our experts. Read: The most and least reliable car brands for 2024, according to Consumer Reports 3. Look for manufacturer or dealership financing deals Monitor the manufacturer and dealership financing deals and jump when you see an attractive low or 0% interest rate offer if your credit is spotless. If it’s not, read on for other ways to save money during car buying.  4. Check your credit score before you shop If you know your credit isn’t the best, find out your score. If you can wait to buy a car and work on lifting your credit score, it could help you qualify for a better, lower interest rate if financing a car. It also helps to inform your budget. 5. Prequalify for a loan If you need car loan financing, check with different lenders for interest-rate offers on new and used cars before shopping. It helps you keep your budget in check and prevents you from overspending.  6. Stick to a budget Use a car affordability calculator to know what you can afford and use that as a guideline when shopping for a car.

Our readers in their comments agree: The Enclave’s strong suits are passenger comfort, impressive cargo capacity, and a usable third row. Reflected in its above-average price (for its class) are an abundance of upmarket standard features. Moreover, its V6 delivers strong, smooth acceleration.

A 9-speed automatic transmission hustles engine output to the front wheels. All-wheel drive is available throughout the Enclave lineup. This horsepower number tops&nbsp;even the best in the midsize SUV&nbsp;segment with only Enclave’s kissing cousin, the Chevy Traverse coming close at 305 horsepower. The Enclave has been clocked in the run from zero-to-60 mph in roughly 6.5 seconds, effectively similar to most 3-row midsize SUVs.</p> <p>A pleasant SUV for the driver and passengers, the Enclave is engineered for open-road cruising. The standard V6 engine smoothly and evenly delivers ample power. Acceleration is satisfying and the suspension is compliant. We find that the steering is precise and responsive. In other words, the Enclave is a delight to drive. Moreover, your passengers will feel like they’re in a higher-end luxury SUV.</p> <p>In part, the Enclave’s pleasant ride comes from its QuietTuning system. This includes active noise cancellation, a laminated acoustic glass windshield, and lots of sound-deadening throughout the body, rendering the cabin whisper-quiet. When it comes to delivering hushed cabins, Buick definitely walks the talk.</p> <p><strong>Don’t miss: </strong><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-your-ultimate-list-of-best-buy-cars-trucks-suvs-and-evs-for-2024-a6c7e632?mod=article_inline\">Here’s your ultimate list of best-buy cars, trucks, SUVs and EVs for 2024</a></p><h2><strong>Fuel economy</strong></h2> <p>Posting a government-estimated 21 mpg in combined driving (18 city, 26 highway), Enclave fuel efficiency falls on the lower side of typical for the segment. Opting for AWD scrubs 1 mpg from the FWD’s number.

			"textContent": "The 2024 Buick Enclave is a 3-row midsize SUV with a roomy, comfy, quiet cabin and loads of premium features. Pricing starts at $43,900.\n       Buick views itself as a premium brand, falling somewhere between mainstream and luxury, and the Enclave follows this path. It’s a step up from the Chevy Traverse, with which it shares some DNA; yet, it isn’t on a par with luxury models like the Cadillac XT6. Our readers in their comments agree: The Enclave’s strong suits are passenger comfort, impressive cargo capacity, and a usable third row. Reflected in its above-average price (for its class) are an abundance of upmarket standard features. Moreover, its V6 delivers strong, smooth acceleration. The Enclave is starting to show its age, but it remains a roomy, comfortable over-the-highway family cruiser.2024 Buick Enclave pricing\n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n            \n      \n    \n      \n      \n\n    \n      \n          The 2024 Buick Enclave\n      \n            Buick\n          \n  \n    \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       The 2024 Buick Enclave starts at $43,900. This is for the entry-level Essence trim. Capping the 3-trim Enclave lineup is the $57,500 Avenir. Adding all-wheel drive to any of the trim levels increases the bottom line by $2,000. The Buick is priced higher than its mainstream-branded competition but much lower than luxury models. For example, the 2024 Subaru \n        FUJHY,\n        +0.56%\n       Ascent at $34,195 and the 2024 Mazda \n        MZDAY,\n        +0.99%\n       CX-90 at $39,595 are only a couple of segment peers on the list of more affordable 3-row midsize SUVs. The Enclave is Buick’s largest SUV.  \n      Enclave Essence\n\n\n       \n      $43,900\n\n\n         \n      Enclave Premium\n\n\n       \n      $51,200\n\n\n         \n      Enclave Avenir\n\n\n       \n      $57,500\n\n\n          These are manufacturer’s suggested retail prices and don’t include the $1,395 factory-to-dealer delivery fee (destination charge).

With an all-new Enclave rumored to be coming in 2025 — its Chevy Traverse cousin has been completely redesigned for 2024 — Buick made no changes to the 2024 model.Power, ride, and handling Buick employs a 310-horsepower V6 to motivate the Enclave. A 9-speed automatic transmission hustles engine output to the front wheels. All-wheel drive is available throughout the Enclave lineup. This horsepower number tops even the best in the midsize SUV segment with only Enclave’s kissing cousin, the Chevy Traverse coming close at 305 horsepower. The Enclave has been clocked in the run from zero-to-60 mph in roughly 6.5 seconds, effectively similar to most 3-row midsize SUVs. A pleasant SUV for the driver and passengers, the Enclave is engineered for open-road cruising. The standard V6 engine smoothly and evenly delivers ample power. Acceleration is satisfying and the suspension is compliant. We find that the steering is precise and responsive. In other words, the Enclave is a delight to drive. Moreover, your passengers will feel like they’re in a higher-end luxury SUV. In part, the Enclave’s pleasant ride comes from its QuietTuning system. This includes active noise cancellation, a laminated acoustic glass windshield, and lots of sound-deadening throughout the body, rendering the cabin whisper-quiet. When it comes to delivering hushed cabins, Buick definitely walks the talk. Don’t miss: Here’s your ultimate list of best-buy cars, trucks, SUVs and EVs for 2024Fuel economy Posting a government-estimated 21 mpg in combined driving (18 city, 26 highway), Enclave fuel efficiency falls on the lower side of typical for the segment. Opting for AWD scrubs 1 mpg from the FWD’s number. You can explore more fuel economy information on the EPA’s website.Welcoming cabin Where the Enclave’s cabin is concerned, it’s tough not to repeat ourselves but we believe this SUV’s interior is a terrific place for a family to spend a day road-tripping. Wonderfully comfortable, loads of space, and user-friendly tech conspire to deliver an ideal family excursion experience. Some of the interior materials aren’t in full support of the Enclave’s premium positioning, but owners rarely mention it.

			"textContent": "A late-night email to Apple Inc.‘s AAPL CEO, Tim Cook, a decade ago could have been the catalyst for the ongoing high-stakes clash between the tech giant and medical device maker Masimo Corporation MASI. The dispute centers on alleged patent infringement, poached talent, and the pivotal role of a blood-oxygen monitoring feature that now defines the Apple Watch’s health capabilities.The SparkIn 2013, a scientist named Marcelo Lamego fired off an email to Cook, pitching a vision that could propel Apple to the forefront of the medical, fitness, and wellness market, Bloomberg reported, citing legal documents. \"I strongly believe that we can develop the new wave of technology that will make Apple the No. 1 brand in the medical, fitness and wellness market,\" he wrote, as per the report.A chain of events then set off, leading Lamego, a former CTO of Cercacor Laboratories (a Masimo sister company), to join Apple. His mission: to contribute to the development of a smartwatch with groundbreaking health sensors. This is reportedly what prompted Masimo’s lawyers to go after Apple.See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple (AAPL) StockThe Patent StormDuring his tenure at Apple, Lamego reportedly urged the filing of numerous patents related to health sensors and algorithms, particularly those detecting blood-oxygen levels in wearables. However, Masimo alleges that Lamego, lacking prior knowledge of this technology, gained expertise at Masimo’s companies before delivering it to Apple. The legal tussle intensified as Masimo claimed that Apple’s recruitment practices infringed on its patents and undermined its business.Lamego resigned shortly after joining, prompting conflicting narratives. While Masimo claims Apple let him go after obtaining the desired sensor technology, a senior Apple executive reportedly contends that Lamego’s departure resulted from a mismatch with the company culture. Apple Watch series timelineThe BanThe culmination of this legal saga saw Apple pulling its latest Watches from U.S. stores, impacting a robust business generating approximately $17 billion annually. A U.S. appellate court recently temporarily halted the ban, providing a respite for Apple in its legal quagmire.The Battle LinesMasimo contends that Lamego took its blood-oxygen monitoring technology to Apple, Bloomberg reported, fortifying the Watch’s position as a leading health device. Apple vehemently denies any wrongdoing, emphasizing internal development timelines and contesting claims of employee poaching. The Road AheadMasimo seeks a settlement that could add Apple to its list of tech companies licensing its medical technology. While Apple has held mediation talks, the saga highlights the intense competition in the lucrative wearables market and the challenges posed by overlapping technologies.Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.Read Next: Apple To Release AI Siri, No Tesla Robotaxi, Reddit Acquisition, Deep Fakes Mar US Elections And More: Deepwater Unveils 2024 Crystal BallImage made vis photos from Shutterstock and Apple© 2023 Benzinga.com.
