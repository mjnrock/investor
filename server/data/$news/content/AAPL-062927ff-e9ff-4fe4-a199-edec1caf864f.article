{"title":"Here's a 'solid contrarian idea' for 2024, according to BTIG's Krinsky","byline":"Jamie Chisholm","dir":null,"lang":"en-US","content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><p>Some technical analysts with a bearish bent also recognize the runes look favorable for the S&amp;P 500 following the latest surge. For example BTIG’s Jonathan Krinsky says the benchmark index may challenge 5,000 early n 2024.</p><div>\n       <p>But let’s not get carried away. Krinsky adds he doesn’t see another big upside move much beyond that level and if the tide turns he warily eyes initial support at 4,600, and with 4,200-4,300 as major long-term support.</p> <p>Furthermore, he spies some concerning issues, such as an uptick in the CBOE VIX index \n        <a data-track-hover=\"QuotePeek\" href=\"/investing/index/VIX?mod=MW_story_quote\" target=\"_blank\">VIX</a>\n       before the Christmas break, even as the market gained ground. </p> <p>The VIX, an option-based gauge of expected S&amp;P 500 volatility, tends to fall when the market goes up, so its rise may indicate some wariness bubbling below the surface. </p> <p>It’s a scenario similar to the market shakeouts witnessed in January 2018 and September 2020, Krinsky notes, and comes as broad market sentiment is chipper with investors’ “positioning back near multi-year highs.”</p>\n        <div data-layout=\"inline\n                \" data-layout-mobile=\"\">\n        \n

resolution from this range in ’24 could be powerful and would suggest relative outperformance after testing 2021 lows,” says Krinsky. “HC has only been the best performing sector in a year once over the last 15 years (2018), and while we can’t say it will be the best in 2024, we do think it is worth a strong look for relative outperformance.”</p>\n        <div data-layout=\"inline\n

For example BTIG’s Jonathan Krinsky says the benchmark index may challenge 5,000 early n 2024.\n       But let’s not get carried away. Krinsky adds he doesn’t see another big upside move much beyond that level and if the tide turns he warily eyes initial support at 4,600, and with 4,200-4,300 as major long-term support. Furthermore, he spies some concerning issues, such as an uptick in the CBOE VIX index \n        VIX\n       before the Christmas break, even as the market gained ground.  The VIX, an option-based gauge of expected S&P 500 volatility, tends to fall when the market goes up, so its rise may indicate some wariness bubbling below the surface.  It’s a scenario similar to the market shakeouts witnessed in January 2018 and September 2020, Krinsky notes, and comes as broad market sentiment is chipper with investors’ “positioning back near multi-year highs.”\n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n            \n      \n    \n      \n      \n\n    \n      \n          \n            Source: BTIG\n          \n  \n    \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       With this in mind, Krinsky  appears wary of chasing sectors of the market that have already been big winners and has his sights on a sector he considers “a solid contrarian idea”: healthcare. As the chart below shows, the healthcare sector has meandered within a trading range for about two and a half years.  “An upside resolution from this range in ’24 could be powerful and would suggest relative outperformance after testing 2021 lows,” says Krinsky. “HC has only been the best performing sector in a year once over the last 15 years (2018), and while we can’t say it will be the best in 2024, we do think it is worth a strong look for relative outperformance.”\n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n            \n      \n    \n      \n      \n\n    \n      \n          Source: BTIG\n  \n    \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       Within the sector, Krinksy notes that smaller companies, as represented by the Invesco S&P SmallCap Health Care ETF \n        PSCH,\n       has begun to break a nearly three-year downtrend relative to bigger companies, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF \n        XLV.\n       “Much like the broad market, we expect small-cap [to do better than] large-cap initially in ’24,” he says.

However, it’s share price is now in an area offering what Krinsky considers is “major support” and  “while it’s not in the Dow any longer, if looking for a contrarian idea similar to the ‘Dogs of the Dow’, this one fits the bill. Eli Lilly on the other hand doesn’t look promising from a technical perspective, says Krinsky: “The stock is up seven years in a row and 12 of the last 13. Feels a bit parabolic lately with weekly momentum rolling over as the stock breaks its medium-term uptrend.”Markets\n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n            \n      \n    \n      \n      \n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       U.S. stock-index futures \n        ES00,\n        +0.01%\n       \n        YM00,\n        +0.07%\n       \n        NQ00,\n        -0.11%\n       are mixed as benchmark Treasury yields \n        BX:TMUBMUSD10Y\n       nudge higher.
